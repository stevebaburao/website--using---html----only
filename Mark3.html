                                After nearly perfecting his Mark II armor, Tony Stark discovered a nearly fatal icing problem in the suit during a high altitude test flight after which he decided to move on to develop the Mark III suit. Stark later solved the suit's icing problem by using a gold-titanium alloy from an earlier satellite design that wasn't prone to freezing. He also opted to integrate a new, miniaturized weapons system that was concealed by the suit's exterior plating. Once the armor was ready for assembly, J.A.R.V.I.S. showed Stark a preview of the finalized design. Stark disliked the armor's new coloring due to the new materials used so he personalized it with a red paint job. <br>
                                <br>
                                After learning that his supposedly discontinued weapons, including a set of his Jericho missiles, were being used by the Ten Rings to terrorize Gulmira, the home village of Ho Yinsen, Stark watched a news report about it enraged as he worked on the Mark III's repulsors. While doing so, he accidentally discovered the palm repulsors can be used as offensive weapons. Stark donned the armor and went off to fight the terrorists. <br>
                                <br>
                                Stark arrived at Gulmira and swiftly defeated the Ten Rings that held him hostage before and destroyed all of their weapons. Doing so, however, called the military's attention so they sent two F-22 fighter jets to investigate. Stark tried to evade and lose the jets but accidentally downed one of them after crashing into its wing, prompting the military to step up its assault. However, Stark was able to prove he isn't a threat after revealing his identity to his friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes and saving the pilot of the downed F-22, whose parachute didn't deploy upon ejecting. The whole incident was later written off to the public as "an unfortunate training accident". Raza noticed the armor and quickly figured it was Tony with an improved version of the armor he used to escape. <br>
                                <br>
                                Sometime later, Tony Stark was confronted by Obadiah Stane, who paralyzed him with a sonic device and took the advanced arc reactor from his chest in order to power his own reversed engineered Iron Monger Armor. After struggling to retrieve his older arc reactor to save his life, Stark suited up in the Mark III and flew to the Stark Industries building to confront Stane and save Pepper Potts. Despite having to use the older, weaker arc reactor, Tony Stark was able to hold his own against Stane's heavier, weapons-laden suit as their battle spread to the nearby streets.
